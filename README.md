## Usage
To use this website is easy. All you have to do is go to the website at [Workout Tracker](https://fast-reef-08065.herokuapp.com/). The website is pretty simple to use. To add a new workout just click the `new workout` button and fallow the input prompts to start a new workout. If you want to add to the latest workout just click on the `continue workout` button and then input the prompts to add another activity to the current workout. If you then look at the dashboard then you will see the last 7 workout in a graph form. At this point this is all the website does but it does have a bunch of other things that can be added to the website in future deployments
